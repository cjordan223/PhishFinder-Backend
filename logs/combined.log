To: Conner JordanConner, I hope you’ve been well since I last reached out about Juniper’s new Secure AI-Native Edge—the first and only secure edge solution that integrates AIOps, networking, and security under a single common cloud and UI. Instead of running duplicate processes or allowing miscommunication to result in network outages or security lapses, a unified approach allows both teams to work together more efficiently and seamlessly. Plus, industry-leading efficacy results for the last five years from reputable test organizations such as CyberRatings.org mean you can buy and deploy Juniper’s offerings with confidence knowing the solution delivers over 99% efficacy in all configurations. I’d love to schedule a 1:1 to discuss how Juniper can help deliver the security you need now and in the future. Let me know your availability and I’ll get something scheduled. Thanks! p.s. If you haven’t already, be sure to register for the upcoming webinarwith security expert Jennifer (JJ) Minella. ------------------------------ RobertStephen Ekwueme Sr. Account Rep | NorCal Juniper Networks | AI Native Network M: 1 408-936-0661 1133 Innovation Way, Sunnyvale, CA 94089 https://www.juniper.net/us/en/If you'd like me to stop sending you emails, please click here

Design based on a Dribbble shot by Oleg Frolov." From Jon Kantner. Chris’ Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. Sometimes a good ol’ *list* is what we need. I know, I know, *this* is forever true. But as my friend Dave is wont to say: *eliminate nuance*. The world doesn’t need nuance on if you should label your inputs by matching the for attribute of the label with the id of the input. You should just do that. Always. Rauno Freiberg has a terrific list that swipes away nuance: Web Interface Guidelines(also on GitHub). Here’s a few: Toggles should immediately take effect, not require confirmation Interactive elements in a vertical or horizontal list should have no dead areas between each element, instead, increase their padding Gradient text should unset the gradient on ::selection state Font weights below 400 should not be used As I read through the list, my *well actually* finger is so ready to fly up. But no, I shall holster it. After all, the list says *guidelines* not *rules* and even if they were taken as rules, the world would probably be better for it for adhering blindly. Break them once you know what you’re doing. ------------------------------ As it often said, accessibility is not a checklist. Butttt a checklistcan be helpful for kickstarting things and moving the needle in the right direction. Forms are an important aspect of accessibility to get right, not to mention a tricky place for UX and security. Speaking of Dave, he’s pretty good lists, and Good formsis one of them. I’ll take just handful of dozens: Good forms have focus states Good form elements leverage the inputmode attribute Good forms validate on the client AND on the server Good forms should do a pre-flight check for navigator.onLine before attempting a submit Good forms make the baby Jesus smile More recently, Dave’s list of Where Web Components Shineis another perfect use of a list. For progressively enhancing regular ass HTML – Super good at this. When your components need to exist across different tech stacks – If your company lets departments pick their own tech stack or your company acquires other companies and you need a bit of UI consistency between projects, web components are a great choice. When you want to make a site without build tools – Build tooling is typically not the starting pointfor most web component projects. That last one makes web components pretty CodePen friendly, just sayin. When are web components not good? There are also plenty of reasons. I’ve dunked on the styling story many times. But here’s another: if you’re building one single web app, you’ll never need to distribute the componentry, and you’re already using a JavaScript framework. ------------------------------ Did you know there are actually four *official* principles of accessibility? I didn’t but Jeremy Keith laid them outwith his takes recently. I recommend taking a deep breath and focusing on the four principles of accessibility. Together they spell out the cutesy acronym POUR: 1. Perceivable 2. Operable 3. Understandable 4. Robust ------------------------------ I can’t help myself but sneak in a CSS one: Replacing React code with CSS :has selectorfrom Nadia Makrevich. That has a *wait, what*? feel to the title since React and CSS are quite different bits of technology, but Nadia makes some good points, mostly around where the state logic can go. I’m a big fan of :has() and CSS will almost certainly be a more performant choice. Still, I have to admit that a bit of basic JSX logic can read a little cleaner than a complex CSS selector decoupled from the relevant HTML. ------------------------------ Since we’re talking about lists and I’m essentially writing this on Halloween, I’d like the remind you that this HTML is perfectly fine and valid:List ItemList ItemList ItemYou can adjust your email preferencesany time, or instantly opt outof emails of this kind.

Design based on a Dribbble shot by Oleg Frolov." From Jon Kantner. Chris’ Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. Sometimes a good ol’ *list* is what we need. I know, I know, *this* is forever true. But as my friend Dave is wont to say: *eliminate nuance*. The world doesn’t need nuance on if you should label your inputs by matching the for attribute of the label with the id of the input. You should just do that. Always. Rauno Freiberg has a terrific list that swipes away nuance: Web Interface Guidelines(also on GitHub). Here’s a few: Toggles should immediately take effect, not require confirmation Interactive elements in a vertical or horizontal list should have no dead areas between each element, instead, increase their padding Gradient text should unset the gradient on ::selection state Font weights below 400 should not be used As I read through the list, my *well actually* finger is so ready to fly up. But no, I shall holster it. After all, the list says *guidelines* not *rules* and even if they were taken as rules, the world would probably be better for it for adhering blindly. Break them once you know what you’re doing. ------------------------------ As it often said, accessibility is not a checklist. Butttt a checklistcan be helpful for kickstarting things and moving the needle in the right direction. Forms are an important aspect of accessibility to get right, not to mention a tricky place for UX and security. Speaking of Dave, he’s pretty good lists, and Good formsis one of them. I’ll take just handful of dozens: Good forms have focus states Good form elements leverage the inputmode attribute Good forms validate on the client AND on the server Good forms should do a pre-flight check for navigator.onLine before attempting a submit Good forms make the baby Jesus smile More recently, Dave’s list of Where Web Components Shineis another perfect use of a list. For progressively enhancing regular ass HTML – Super good at this. When your components need to exist across different tech stacks – If your company lets departments pick their own tech stack or your company acquires other companies and you need a bit of UI consistency between projects, web components are a great choice. When you want to make a site without build tools – Build tooling is typically not the starting pointfor most web component projects. That last one makes web components pretty CodePen friendly, just sayin. When are web components not good? There are also plenty of reasons. I’ve dunked on the styling story many times. But here’s another: if you’re building one single web app, you’ll never need to distribute the componentry, and you’re already using a JavaScript framework. ------------------------------ Did you know there are actually four *official* principles of accessibility? I didn’t but Jeremy Keith laid them outwith his takes recently. I recommend taking a deep breath and focusing on the four principles of accessibility. Together they spell out the cutesy acronym POUR: 1. Perceivable 2. Operable 3. Understandable 4. Robust ------------------------------ I can’t help myself but sneak in a CSS one: Replacing React code with CSS :has selectorfrom Nadia Makrevich. That has a *wait, what*? feel to the title since React and CSS are quite different bits of technology, but Nadia makes some good points, mostly around where the state logic can go. I’m a big fan of :has() and CSS will almost certainly be a more performant choice. Still, I have to admit that a bit of basic JSX logic can read a little cleaner than a complex CSS selector decoupled from the relevant HTML. ------------------------------ Since we’re talking about lists and I’m essentially writing this on Halloween, I’d like the remind you that this HTML is perfectly fine and valid:List ItemList ItemList ItemYou can adjust your email preferencesany time, or instantly opt outof emails of this kind.

2024-11-09 09:54:16 [info]: Cleaned body: The artist's studio smelled of linseed oil and turpentine, with afternoon light streaming through dusty windows to illuminate half-finished canvases propped against every available surface. In the center of the chaos stood an easel holding her latest work - a massive abstract piece dominated by swirling reds and golds that seemed to move and shift when viewed from different angles. She had been working on it for months, trying to capture something she couldn't quite articulate in words.

Children from the neighboring school visited weekly to learn about ecology and sustainable agriculture, their small hands dirty from planting seeds and pulling weeds. What had once been a symbol of neighborhood decline had become a source of fresh food and pride for local residents.

Every morning, the same group of retirees gathered at the counter, ordering coffee black as midnight and eggs sunny side up, while trading stories they'd all heard a hundred times before. The vinyl booths might be cracked, and the linoleum floor worn to a dull sheen, but the coffee was hot and the conversation warm.

None of my scripts are removing it entirely which is causing the reinstall/update to fail. The funny part is this process shouldn't even need a custom worklet. Citrix is supposed to be a "Supported App" with AX. You're supposed to just select all devices and hit "patch" and be done. But their worklet doesn't take into account citrix is almost always running, and won't update when running.

For decades it had guided ships safely through the treacherous channel, but now, in the age of GPS and automated navigation, it served mainly as a tourist attraction. Still, on nights like this, when the fog rolled in thick as wool and the waves crashed against the rocks below, the keeper maintained the light out of respect for tradition and the slim chance that some sailor might still look to its steady beam for guidance.

2024-11-09 09:54:17 [info]: Cleaned body: he Early Beginnings of Technological Innovation The history of technology begins with the earliest tools crafted by our ancestors. Simple stone implements allowed early humans to hunt, build shelters, and defend themselves from predators. Over time, these primitive tools evolved into more complex inventions, including metalworking, agriculture, and the wheel, which revolutionized transportation and trade. Each advancement brought societies closer together, enabling the exchange of goods, ideas, and culture. The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, marked a pivotal moment in the history of technology. Machines replaced manual labor in many industries, allowing for mass production of goods and transforming economies across Europe and the United States. Steam engines, textile machinery, and railroads became the hallmarks of the era, drastically reducing the time and cost of manufacturing and transportation. However, these advancements also came with significant social upheaval, as rural populations migrated to cities in search of factory work, leading to overcrowded urban areas and challenging living conditions. The Digital Revolution The 20th century saw the emergence of the Digital Revolution, a period characterized by the rapid advancement of computing technology. The invention of the transistor in 1947 paved the way for the development of computers, and by the mid-20th century, computers were already beginning to transform industries like finance, science, and education. What began as massive, room-sized machines eventually gave rise to personal computers, which brought computing power to homes and small businesses. The advent of the internet in the late 20th century further accelerated technological progress. Originally developed as a tool for military and academic research, the internet quickly evolved into a global network that connected people, organizations, and institutions in ways never before possible. By the 1990s, the World Wide Web was revolutionizing commerce, communication, and entertainment, laying the foundation for the modern digital economy. Today, nearly every aspect of life is touched by digital technology. Smartphones, cloud computing, and social media have transformed how people access information, interact with others, and consume goods and services. The rise of e-commerce giants like Amazon and Alibaba has changed the retail landscape, while platforms like Facebook and Twitter have reshaped social relationships, politics, and media consumption. The proliferation of digital tools has also empowered individuals to become creators, giving rise to new industries like online content creation, streaming, and the gig economy.

2024-11-09 09:54:17 [info]: Cleaned body: *The Evolution of Technology and Its Impact on Society* Technology has been a driving force behind human development since the dawn of civilization. From the invention of the wheel to the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, technology has continually reshaped the world around us, altering how we live, work, and interact with one another. The pace of technological evolution has accelerated rapidly in recent centuries, and today, we are witnessing advancements that were once confined to the realms of science fiction. These innovations have had profound effects on society, economy, culture, and even individual identity, raising both opportunities and challenges. The Early Beginnings of Technological Innovation The history of technology begins with the earliest tools crafted by our ancestors. Simple stone implements allowed early humans to hunt, build shelters, and defend themselves from predators. Over time, these primitive tools evolved into more complex inventions, including metalworking, agriculture, and the wheel, which revolutionized transportation and trade. Each advancement brought societies closer together, enabling the exchange of goods, ideas, and culture. The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, marked a pivotal moment in the history of technology. Machines replaced manual labor in many industries, allowing for mass production of goods and transforming economies across Europe and the United States. Steam engines, textile machinery, and railroads became the hallmarks of the era, drastically reducing the time and cost of manufacturing and transportation. However, these advancements also came with significant social upheaval, as rural populations migrated to cities in search of factory work, leading to overcrowded urban areas and challenging living conditions. The Digital Revolution The 20th century saw the emergence of the Digital Revolution, a period characterized by the rapid advancement of computing technology. The invention of the transistor in 1947 paved the way for the development of computers, and by the mid-20th century, computers were already beginning to transform industries like finance, science, and education. What began as massive, room-sized machines eventually gave rise to personal computers, which brought computing power to homes and small businesses. The advent of the internet in the late 20th century further accelerated technological progress. Originally developed as a tool for military and academic research, the internet quickly evolved into a global network that connected people, organizations, and institutions in ways never before possible. By the 1990s, the World Wide Web was revolutionizing commerce, communication, and entertainment, laying the foundation for the modern digital economy. Today, nearly every aspect of life is touched by digital technology. Smartphones, cloud computing, and social media have transformed how people access information, interact with others, and consume goods and services. The rise of e-commerce giants like Amazon and Alibaba has changed the retail landscape, while platforms like Facebook and Twitter have reshaped social relationships, politics, and media consumption. The proliferation of digital tools has also empowered individuals to become creators, giving rise to new industries like online content creation, streaming, and the gig economy. The Role of Artificial Intelligence One of the most significant technological advancements of the 21st century has been the development of artificial intelligence (AI). AI refers to the ability of machines to mimic human cognitive processes such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. While the concept of AI has existed for decades, recent breakthroughs in machine learning and neural networks have made it a reality. AI-powered systems are now capable of performing tasks that were once the exclusive domain of humans. From self-driving cars and virtual assistants to complex algorithms used in finance and healthcare, AI is transforming industries at an unprecedented rate. For example, in healthcare, AI is being used to analyze medical images, assist in diagnostics, and even predict disease outbreaks. In finance, AI-driven algorithms are used to detect fraudulent transactions, optimize trading strategies, and assess credit risk. However, the rise of AI has also sparked concerns about job displacement and the ethical implications of automation. As machines become increasingly capable of performing tasks that once required human labor, there is growing fear that many jobs will become obsolete. Industries such as manufacturing, transportation, and customer service are already feeling the effects of automation, with robots and AI systems replacing workers in some sectors. This has led to calls for policies that address the societal impact of automation, including retraining programs and universal basic income proposals. The Promise and Perils of Emerging Technologies In addition to AI, several other emerging technologies are poised to reshape the future. Blockchain technology, which underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, is being explored for its potential to revolutionize industries such as finance, supply chain management, and voting systems. By enabling decentralized and transparent record-keeping, blockchain could reduce fraud, increase efficiency, and empower individuals to take control of their data. Meanwhile, advancements in biotechnology and genetic engineering are opening up new possibilities in healthcare and agriculture. The development of CRISPR-Cas9, a gene-editing tool, has made it possible to modify the DNA of living organisms with unprecedented precision. This technology holds promise for treating genetic diseases, improving crop yields, and even creating new forms of life. However, it also raises ethical questions about the potential for misuse and unintended consequences. Quantum computing is another technology that could dramatically alter the landscape of computing. Unlike traditional computers, which process information in binary form (0s and 1s), quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations at speeds previously thought impossible. While still in its early stages, quantum computing could unlock new possibilities in fields like cryptography, drug discovery, and materials science. As these technologies continue to develop, society will face critical choices about how to integrate them responsibly. While the potential benefits are immense, there are also risks that must be carefully managed. Privacy concerns, data security, and the ethical implications of automation and AI are just a few of the challenges that will need to be addressed. The Future of Human-Technology Interaction Looking ahead, the relationship between humans and technology is likely to become even more intertwined. The concept of the "metaverse"—a virtual reality space where users can interact with digital environments and other users—has gained significant attention in recent years. Companies like Facebook (now Meta) are investing heavily in developing virtual worlds that could redefine social interaction, entertainment, and work. At the same time, advancements in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) could enable direct communication between the human brain and machines. This technology has the potential to restore lost functions for individuals with disabilities, enhance cognitive abilities, and even merge human consciousness with artificial intelligence. As technology continues to evolve, one thing is clear: its impact on society will be profound and far-reaching. The challenge for humanity will be to harness the power of these innovations while ensuring that they are used in ways that promote fairness, equality, and sustainability.

To: Conner JordanConner, I hope you’ve been well since I last reached out about Juniper’s new Secure AI-Native Edge—the first and only secure edge solution that integrates AIOps, networking, and security under a single common cloud and UI. Instead of running duplicate processes or allowing miscommunication to result in network outages or security lapses, a unified approach allows both teams to work together more efficiently and seamlessly. Plus, industry-leading efficacy results for the last five years from reputable test organizations such as CyberRatings.org mean you can buy and deploy Juniper’s offerings with confidence knowing the solution delivers over 99% efficacy in all configurations. I’d love to schedule a 1:1 to discuss how Juniper can help deliver the security you need now and in the future. Let me know your availability and I’ll get something scheduled. Thanks! p.s. If you haven’t already, be sure to register for the upcoming webinarwith security expert Jennifer (JJ) Minella. ------------------------------ RobertStephen Ekwueme Sr. Account Rep | NorCal Juniper Networks | AI Native Network M: 1 408-936-0661 1133 Innovation Way, Sunnyvale, CA 94089 https://www.juniper.net/us/en/If you'd like me to stop sending you emails, please click here

Design based on a Dribbble shot by Oleg Frolov." From Jon Kantner. Chris’ Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. Sometimes a good ol’ *list* is what we need. I know, I know, *this* is forever true. But as my friend Dave is wont to say: *eliminate nuance*. The world doesn’t need nuance on if you should label your inputs by matching the for attribute of the label with the id of the input. You should just do that. Always. Rauno Freiberg has a terrific list that swipes away nuance: Web Interface Guidelines(also on GitHub). Here’s a few: Toggles should immediately take effect, not require confirmation Interactive elements in a vertical or horizontal list should have no dead areas between each element, instead, increase their padding Gradient text should unset the gradient on ::selection state Font weights below 400 should not be used As I read through the list, my *well actually* finger is so ready to fly up. But no, I shall holster it. After all, the list says *guidelines* not *rules* and even if they were taken as rules, the world would probably be better for it for adhering blindly. Break them once you know what you’re doing. ------------------------------ As it often said, accessibility is not a checklist. Butttt a checklistcan be helpful for kickstarting things and moving the needle in the right direction. Forms are an important aspect of accessibility to get right, not to mention a tricky place for UX and security. Speaking of Dave, he’s pretty good lists, and Good formsis one of them. I’ll take just handful of dozens: Good forms have focus states Good form elements leverage the inputmode attribute Good forms validate on the client AND on the server Good forms should do a pre-flight check for navigator.onLine before attempting a submit Good forms make the baby Jesus smile More recently, Dave’s list of Where Web Components Shineis another perfect use of a list. For progressively enhancing regular ass HTML – Super good at this. When your components need to exist across different tech stacks – If your company lets departments pick their own tech stack or your company acquires other companies and you need a bit of UI consistency between projects, web components are a great choice. When you want to make a site without build tools – Build tooling is typically not the starting pointfor most web component projects. That last one makes web components pretty CodePen friendly, just sayin. When are web components not good? There are also plenty of reasons. I’ve dunked on the styling story many times. But here’s another: if you’re building one single web app, you’ll never need to distribute the componentry, and you’re already using a JavaScript framework. ------------------------------ Did you know there are actually four *official* principles of accessibility? I didn’t but Jeremy Keith laid them outwith his takes recently. I recommend taking a deep breath and focusing on the four principles of accessibility. Together they spell out the cutesy acronym POUR: 1. Perceivable 2. Operable 3. Understandable 4. Robust ------------------------------ I can’t help myself but sneak in a CSS one: Replacing React code with CSS :has selectorfrom Nadia Makrevich. That has a *wait, what*? feel to the title since React and CSS are quite different bits of technology, but Nadia makes some good points, mostly around where the state logic can go. I’m a big fan of :has() and CSS will almost certainly be a more performant choice. Still, I have to admit that a bit of basic JSX logic can read a little cleaner than a complex CSS selector decoupled from the relevant HTML. ------------------------------ Since we’re talking about lists and I’m essentially writing this on Halloween, I’d like the remind you that this HTML is perfectly fine and valid:List ItemList ItemList ItemYou can adjust your email preferencesany time, or instantly opt outof emails of this kind.

2024-11-09 10:02:33 [info]: Cleaned body: The urban garden project had transformed an abandoned lot into a thriving community space, where rows of vegetables grew alongside flowering native plants. Children from the neighboring school visited weekly to learn about ecology and sustainable agriculture, their small hands dirty from planting seeds and pulling weeds. What had once been a symbol of neighborhood decline had become a source of fresh food and pride for local residents.

2024-11-09 10:02:33 [info]: Cleaned body: The small town diner hadn't changed its menu in forty years, and that's exactly how the locals liked it. Every morning, the same group of retirees gathered at the counter, ordering coffee black as midnight and eggs sunny side up, while trading stories they'd all heard a hundred times before. The vinyl booths might be cracked, and the linoleum floor worn to a dull sheen, but the coffee was hot and the conversation warm.

None of my scripts are removing it entirely which is causing the reinstall/update to fail. The funny part is this process shouldn't even need a custom worklet. Citrix is supposed to be a "Supported App" with AX. You're supposed to just select all devices and hit "patch" and be done. But their worklet doesn't take into account citrix is almost always running, and won't update when running.

The proliferation of digital tools has also empowered individuals to become creators, giving rise to new industries like online content creation, streaming, and the gig economy. The Role of Artificial Intelligence One of the most significant technological advancements of the 21st century has been the development of artificial intelligence (AI). AI refers to the ability of machines to mimic human cognitive processes such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. While the concept of AI has existed for decades, recent breakthroughs in machine learning and neural networks have made it a reality. AI-powered systems are now capable of performing tasks that were once the exclusive domain of humans. From self-driving cars and virtual assistants to complex algorithms used in finance and healthcare, AI is transforming industries at an unprecedented rate. For example, in healthcare, AI is being used to analyze medical images, assist in diagnostics, and even predict disease outbreaks. In finance, AI-driven algorithms are used to detect fraudulent transactions, optimize trading strategies, and assess credit risk. However, the rise of AI has also sparked concerns about job displacement and the ethical implications of automation. As machines become increasingly capable of performing tasks that once required human labor, there is growing fear that many jobs will become obsolete. Industries such as manufacturing, transportation, and customer service are already feeling the effects of automation, with robots and AI systems replacing workers in some sectors. This has led to calls for policies that address the societal impact of automation, including retraining programs and universal basic income proposals. The Promise and Perils of Emerging Technologies In addition to AI, several other emerging technologies are poised to reshape the future. Blockchain technology, which underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, is being explored for its potential to revolutionize industries such as finance, supply chain management, and voting systems. By enabling decentralized and transparent record-keeping, blockchain could reduce fraud, increase efficiency, and empower individuals to take control of their data. Meanwhile, advancements in biotechnology and genetic engineering are opening up new possibilities in healthcare and agriculture. The development of CRISPR-Cas9, a gene-editing tool, has made it possible to modify the DNA of living organisms with unprecedented precision. This technology holds promise for treating genetic diseases, improving crop yields, and even creating new forms of life. However, it also raises ethical questions about the potential for misuse and unintended consequences. Quantum computing is another technology that could dramatically alter the landscape of computing. Unlike traditional computers, which process information in binary form (0s and 1s), quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations at speeds previously thought impossible. While still in its early stages, quantum computing could unlock new possibilities in fields like cryptography, drug discovery, and materials science. As these technologies continue to develop, society will face critical choices about how to integrate them responsibly. While the potential benefits are immense, there are also risks that must be carefully managed. Privacy concerns, data security, and the ethical implications of automation and AI are just a few of the challenges that will need to be addressed. The Future of Human-Technology Interaction Looking ahead, the relationship between humans and technology is likely to become even more intertwined. The concept of the "metaverse"—a virtual reality space where users can interact with digital environments and other users—has gained significant attention in recent years. Companies like Facebook (now Meta) are investing heavily in developing virtual worlds that could redefine social interaction, entertainment, and work. At the same time, advancements in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) could enable direct communication between the human brain and machines. This technology has the potential to restore lost functions for individuals with disabilities, enhance cognitive abilities, and even merge human consciousness with artificial intelligence. As technology continues to evolve, one thing is clear: its impact on society will be profound and far-reaching. The challenge for humanity will be to harness the power of these innovations while ensuring that they are used in ways that promote fairness, equality, and sustainability.

2024-11-09 10:07:31 [info]: Cleaned body: A forgotten box in the attic revealed a collection of letters from the 1940s, each one carefully tied with faded blue ribbon. The paper had yellowed with age, but the ink remained clear, telling a love story that spanned continents and survived a world war. The current homeowners spent hours reading through them, piecing together the lives of people they had never met but now felt they knew intimately.

2024-11-09 10:07:31 [info]: Cleaned body: Deep in the Amazon rainforest, a previously unknown species of orchid had just been discovered blooming in the canopy. Its petals shimmered with an iridescent blue that seemed to pulse in the dappled sunlight, while its delicate fragrance attracted a unique species of moth never before documented by science. The researchers who found it spent hours photographing and cataloging every aspect of this botanical treasure, knowing that such discoveries were becoming increasingly rare in our rapidly changing world.

To: Conner JordanConner, I hope you’ve been well since I last reached out about Juniper’s new Secure AI-Native Edge—the first and only secure edge solution that integrates AIOps, networking, and security under a single common cloud and UI. Instead of running duplicate processes or allowing miscommunication to result in network outages or security lapses, a unified approach allows both teams to work together more efficiently and seamlessly. Plus, industry-leading efficacy results for the last five years from reputable test organizations such as CyberRatings.org mean you can buy and deploy Juniper’s offerings with confidence knowing the solution delivers over 99% efficacy in all configurations. I’d love to schedule a 1:1 to discuss how Juniper can help deliver the security you need now and in the future. Let me know your availability and I’ll get something scheduled. Thanks! p.s. If you haven’t already, be sure to register for the upcoming webinarwith security expert Jennifer (JJ) Minella. ------------------------------ RobertStephen Ekwueme Sr. Account Rep | NorCal Juniper Networks | AI Native Network M: 1 408-936-0661 1133 Innovation Way, Sunnyvale, CA 94089 https://www.juniper.net/us/en/If you'd like me to stop sending you emails, please click here

Design based on a Dribbble shot by Oleg Frolov." From Jon Kantner. Chris’ Corner A collection of web design and development news and thoughts from CodePen's own Chris Coyier. Sometimes a good ol’ *list* is what we need. I know, I know, *this* is forever true. But as my friend Dave is wont to say: *eliminate nuance*. The world doesn’t need nuance on if you should label your inputs by matching the for attribute of the label with the id of the input. You should just do that. Always. Rauno Freiberg has a terrific list that swipes away nuance: Web Interface Guidelines(also on GitHub). Here’s a few: Toggles should immediately take effect, not require confirmation Interactive elements in a vertical or horizontal list should have no dead areas between each element, instead, increase their padding Gradient text should unset the gradient on ::selection state Font weights below 400 should not be used As I read through the list, my *well actually* finger is so ready to fly up. But no, I shall holster it. After all, the list says *guidelines* not *rules* and even if they were taken as rules, the world would probably be better for it for adhering blindly. Break them once you know what you’re doing. ------------------------------ As it often said, accessibility is not a checklist. Butttt a checklistcan be helpful for kickstarting things and moving the needle in the right direction. Forms are an important aspect of accessibility to get right, not to mention a tricky place for UX and security. Speaking of Dave, he’s pretty good lists, and Good formsis one of them. I’ll take just handful of dozens: Good forms have focus states Good form elements leverage the inputmode attribute Good forms validate on the client AND on the server Good forms should do a pre-flight check for navigator.onLine before attempting a submit Good forms make the baby Jesus smile More recently, Dave’s list of Where Web Components Shineis another perfect use of a list. For progressively enhancing regular ass HTML – Super good at this. When your components need to exist across different tech stacks – If your company lets departments pick their own tech stack or your company acquires other companies and you need a bit of UI consistency between projects, web components are a great choice. When you want to make a site without build tools – Build tooling is typically not the starting pointfor most web component projects. That last one makes web components pretty CodePen friendly, just sayin. When are web components not good? There are also plenty of reasons. I’ve dunked on the styling story many times. But here’s another: if you’re building one single web app, you’ll never need to distribute the componentry, and you’re already using a JavaScript framework. ------------------------------ Did you know there are actually four *official* principles of accessibility? I didn’t but Jeremy Keith laid them outwith his takes recently. I recommend taking a deep breath and focusing on the four principles of accessibility. Together they spell out the cutesy acronym POUR: 1. Perceivable 2. Operable 3. Understandable 4. Robust ------------------------------ I can’t help myself but sneak in a CSS one: Replacing React code with CSS :has selectorfrom Nadia Makrevich. That has a *wait, what*? feel to the title since React and CSS are quite different bits of technology, but Nadia makes some good points, mostly around where the state logic can go. I’m a big fan of :has() and CSS will almost certainly be a more performant choice. Still, I have to admit that a bit of basic JSX logic can read a little cleaner than a complex CSS selector decoupled from the relevant HTML. ------------------------------ Since we’re talking about lists and I’m essentially writing this on Halloween, I’d like the remind you that this HTML is perfectly fine and valid:List ItemList ItemList ItemYou can adjust your email preferencesany time, or instantly opt outof emails of this kind.

2024-11-09 10:49:00 [info]: Cleaned body: A forgotten box in the attic revealed a collection of letters from the 1940s, each one carefully tied with faded blue ribbon. The paper had yellowed with age, but the ink remained clear, telling a love story that spanned continents and survived a world war. The current homeowners spent hours reading through them, piecing together the lives of people they had never met but now felt they knew intimately.

None of my scripts are removing it entirely which is causing the reinstall/update to fail. The funny part is this process shouldn't even need a custom worklet. Citrix is supposed to be a "Supported App" with AX. You're supposed to just select all devices and hit "patch" and be done. But their worklet doesn't take into account citrix is almost always running, and won't update when running.

2024-11-09 10:49:01 [info]: Cleaned body: *The Evolution of Technology and Its Impact on Society* Technology has been a driving force behind human development since the dawn of civilization. From the invention of the wheel to the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, technology has continually reshaped the world around us, altering how we live, work, and interact with one another. The pace of technological evolution has accelerated rapidly in recent centuries, and today, we are witnessing advancements that were once confined to the realms of science fiction. These innovations have had profound effects on society, economy, culture, and even individual identity, raising both opportunities and challenges. The Early Beginnings of Technological Innovation The history of technology begins with the earliest tools crafted by our ancestors. Simple stone implements allowed early humans to hunt, build shelters, and defend themselves from predators. Over time, these primitive tools evolved into more complex inventions, including metalworking, agriculture, and the wheel, which revolutionized transportation and trade. Each advancement brought societies closer together, enabling the exchange of goods, ideas, and culture. The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, marked a pivotal moment in the history of technology. Machines replaced manual labor in many industries, allowing for mass production of goods and transforming economies across Europe and the United States. Steam engines, textile machinery, and railroads became the hallmarks of the era, drastically reducing the time and cost of manufacturing and transportation. However, these advancements also came with significant social upheaval, as rural populations migrated to cities in search of factory work, leading to overcrowded urban areas and challenging living conditions. The Digital Revolution The 20th century saw the emergence of the Digital Revolution, a period characterized by the rapid advancement of computing technology. The invention of the transistor in 1947 paved the way for the development of computers, and by the mid-20th century, computers were already beginning to transform industries like finance, science, and education. What began as massive, room-sized machines eventually gave rise to personal computers, which brought computing power to homes and small businesses. The advent of the internet in the late 20th century further accelerated technological progress. Originally developed as a tool for military and academic research, the internet quickly evolved into a global network that connected people, organizations, and institutions in ways never before possible. By the 1990s, the World Wide Web was revolutionizing commerce, communication, and entertainment, laying the foundation for the modern digital economy. Today, nearly every aspect of life is touched by digital technology. Smartphones, cloud computing, and social media have transformed how people access information, interact with others, and consume goods and services. The rise of e-commerce giants like Amazon and Alibaba has changed the retail landscape, while platforms like Facebook and Twitter have reshaped social relationships, politics, and media consumption. The proliferation of digital tools has also empowered individuals to become creators, giving rise to new industries like online content creation, streaming, and the gig economy. The Role of Artificial Intelligence One of the most significant technological advancements of the 21st century has been the development of artificial intelligence (AI). AI refers to the ability of machines to mimic human cognitive processes such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. While the concept of AI has existed for decades, recent breakthroughs in machine learning and neural networks have made it a reality. AI-powered systems are now capable of performing tasks that were once the exclusive domain of humans. From self-driving cars and virtual assistants to complex algorithms used in finance and healthcare, AI is transforming industries at an unprecedented rate. For example, in healthcare, AI is being used to analyze medical images, assist in diagnostics, and even predict disease outbreaks. In finance, AI-driven algorithms are used to detect fraudulent transactions, optimize trading strategies, and assess credit risk. However, the rise of AI has also sparked concerns about job displacement and the ethical implications of automation. As machines become increasingly capable of performing tasks that once required human labor, there is growing fear that many jobs will become obsolete. Industries such as manufacturing, transportation, and customer service are already feeling the effects of automation, with robots and AI systems replacing workers in some sectors. This has led to calls for policies that address the societal impact of automation, including retraining programs and universal basic income proposals. The Promise and Perils of Emerging Technologies In addition to AI, several other emerging technologies are poised to reshape the future. Blockchain technology, which underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, is being explored for its potential to revolutionize industries such as finance, supply chain management, and voting systems. By enabling decentralized and transparent record-keeping, blockchain could reduce fraud, increase efficiency, and empower individuals to take control of their data. Meanwhile, advancements in biotechnology and genetic engineering are opening up new possibilities in healthcare and agriculture. The development of CRISPR-Cas9, a gene-editing tool, has made it possible to modify the DNA of living organisms with unprecedented precision. This technology holds promise for treating genetic diseases, improving crop yields, and even creating new forms of life. However, it also raises ethical questions about the potential for misuse and unintended consequences. Quantum computing is another technology that could dramatically alter the landscape of computing. Unlike traditional computers, which process information in binary form (0s and 1s), quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations at speeds previously thought impossible. While still in its early stages, quantum computing could unlock new possibilities in fields like cryptography, drug discovery, and materials science. As these technologies continue to develop, society will face critical choices about how to integrate them responsibly. While the potential benefits are immense, there are also risks that must be carefully managed. Privacy concerns, data security, and the ethical implications of automation and AI are just a few of the challenges that will need to be addressed. The Future of Human-Technology Interaction Looking ahead, the relationship between humans and technology is likely to become even more intertwined. The concept of the "metaverse"—a virtual reality space where users can interact with digital environments and other users—has gained significant attention in recent years. Companies like Facebook (now Meta) are investing heavily in developing virtual worlds that could redefine social interaction, entertainment, and work. At the same time, advancements in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) could enable direct communication between the human brain and machines. This technology has the potential to restore lost functions for individuals with disabilities, enhance cognitive abilities, and even merge human consciousness with artificial intelligence. As technology continues to evolve, one thing is clear: its impact on society will be profound and far-reaching. The challenge for humanity will be to harness the power of these innovations while ensuring that they are used in ways that promote fairness, equality, and sustainability.

2024-11-09 11:02:34 [info]: Cleaned body: Conner Jordan (805) 238 5514 ext. 204 902 21st St. Paso Robles ---------- Forwarded message --------- From: Robert Stephen EkwuemeDate: Mon, Nov 4, 2024 at 10:00 AM Subject: Behold the power of a unified network security approach! To: Conner JordanConner, I hope you’ve been well since I last reached out about Juniper’s new Secure AI-Native Edge—the first and only secure edge solution that integrates AIOps, networking, and security under a single common cloud and UI. Instead of running duplicate processes or allowing miscommunication to result in network outages or security lapses, a unified approach allows both teams to work together more efficiently and seamlessly. Plus, industry-leading efficacy results for the last five years from reputable test organizations such as CyberRatings.org mean you can buy and deploy Juniper’s offerings with confidence knowing the solution delivers over 99% efficacy in all configurations. I’d love to schedule a 1:1 to discuss how Juniper can help deliver the security you need now and in the future. Let me know your availability and I’ll get something scheduled. Thanks! p.s. If you haven’t already, be sure to register for the upcoming webinarwith security expert Jennifer (JJ) Minella. ------------------------------ RobertStephen Ekwueme Sr. Account Rep | NorCal Juniper Networks | AI Native Network M: 1 408-936-0661 1133 Innovation Way, Sunnyvale, CA 94089 https://www.juniper.net/us/en/If you'd like me to stop sending you emails, please click here

2024-11-09 11:02:34 [info]: Cleaned body: he Early Beginnings of Technological Innovation The history of technology begins with the earliest tools crafted by our ancestors. Simple stone implements allowed early humans to hunt, build shelters, and defend themselves from predators. Over time, these primitive tools evolved into more complex inventions, including metalworking, agriculture, and the wheel, which revolutionized transportation and trade. Each advancement brought societies closer together, enabling the exchange of goods, ideas, and culture. The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, marked a pivotal moment in the history of technology. Machines replaced manual labor in many industries, allowing for mass production of goods and transforming economies across Europe and the United States. Steam engines, textile machinery, and railroads became the hallmarks of the era, drastically reducing the time and cost of manufacturing and transportation. However, these advancements also came with significant social upheaval, as rural populations migrated to cities in search of factory work, leading to overcrowded urban areas and challenging living conditions. The Digital Revolution The 20th century saw the emergence of the Digital Revolution, a period characterized by the rapid advancement of computing technology. The invention of the transistor in 1947 paved the way for the development of computers, and by the mid-20th century, computers were already beginning to transform industries like finance, science, and education. What began as massive, room-sized machines eventually gave rise to personal computers, which brought computing power to homes and small businesses. The advent of the internet in the late 20th century further accelerated technological progress. Originally developed as a tool for military and academic research, the internet quickly evolved into a global network that connected people, organizations, and institutions in ways never before possible. By the 1990s, the World Wide Web was revolutionizing commerce, communication, and entertainment, laying the foundation for the modern digital economy. Today, nearly every aspect of life is touched by digital technology. Smartphones, cloud computing, and social media have transformed how people access information, interact with others, and consume goods and services. The rise of e-commerce giants like Amazon and Alibaba has changed the retail landscape, while platforms like Facebook and Twitter have reshaped social relationships, politics, and media consumption. The proliferation of digital tools has also empowered individuals to become creators, giving rise to new industries like online content creation, streaming, and the gig economy.
